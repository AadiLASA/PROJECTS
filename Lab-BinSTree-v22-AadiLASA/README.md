Binary Tree Implementation

There are many ways to implement the insert() and remove() functions.  The code in this lab was derived from a working version of the code.  The functioning code for insert() and remove() has been stripped out with comments replacing the code.  

The code is designed to prompt "Tree insert" for a list of integer key values.  Hit return after each key value.  A negative value indicates the end of the input.  The code then prompts for "Tree remove" for any item keys to be removed from tree.  The remove list is entered as described for the insert.
